def cut_size(G, c1, c2, weight='weight'):
    """Determine the cut size between two communities

    The cut size is the sum of the costs (weights) of the edges
    between two sets. For unweighted graphs the cost of an edge
    is 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
    c1,c2 : set
      community 1
    weight : key
      Edge data key to use as weight.  If None all edges have weight 1.

    Returns
    -------
    cut_size: int
      Number of edges between two communities

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.barbell_graph(3,0)
    >>> nx.cut_size(G,nx.spectral_partition(G),0,1)
    1

    Notes
    -----
    If Using MultiGraph or MultiDiGraph the cut is the total number
    of edges including multiplicity, or the sum of the weights on
