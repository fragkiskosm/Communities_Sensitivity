    The Mutual Information is a measure of the similarity between two labels of
    the same data. Where :math:`P(i)` is the probability of a random sample
    occurring in cluster :math:`U_i` and :math:`P'(j)` is the probability of a
    random sample occurring in cluster :math:`V_j`, the Mutual Information
    between clusterings :math:`U` and :math:`V` is given as:
    .. math::
        MI(U,V)=\sum_{i=1}^R \sum_{j=1}^C P(i,j)\log\\frac{P(i,j)}{P(i)P'(j)}
    This is equal to the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the joint distribution
    with the product distribution of the marginals.
    This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels:
    a permutation of the class or cluster label values won't change the
    score value in any way.
    This metric is furthermore symmetric: switching ``label_true`` with
    ``label_pred`` will return the same score value. This can be useful to
    measure the agreement of two independent label assignments strategies
    on the same dataset when the real ground truth is not known.
    Parameters
    ----------
    labels_true : int array, shape = [n_samples]
        A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.
    labels_pred : array, shape = [n_samples]
        A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.
    contingency: None or array, shape = [n_classes_true, n_classes_pred]
        A contingency matrix given by the :func:`contingency_matrix` function.
        If value is ``None``, it will be computed, otherwise the given value is
        used, with ``labels_true`` and ``labels_pred`` ignored.

    -------
    mi: float
